# Week9_Lec

This set contains codes to implement k-means algorithms. 
At the end of the exercise, logics contained in helper.py 
should be re-implemented in corresponding codes.

Steps:
- Implement missing functions in sample_student.py
- Then the util module
- Next, update and computeCentroid in Cluster class
- Finall, the main iteration in kmeans.py
